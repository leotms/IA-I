COMPILE WITH:

  make  15Puzzle.astar_manhatan N=2 or make  Pancakes28.astar_gap N=2
  for A* algorithm.

  make  15Puzzle.idastar_manhatan N=2 or make  Pancakes28.idastar_gap N=2
  for IDA* algorithm.

  N=2 is the length of the suffix for tree pruning that guarantees the
  best search tree.

RUN:

  ./<ProblemName>.<algorithm>_<heuristic> <inputfile> <outputfile>

	where:
    <ProblemName> is the problem to be solved. i.e. Pancake28
    <algorithm>   is the algorithm A* or IDA*
    <heuristic>   is the heuristic used. GAP for Pancakes and Manhatan for 15Puzzle.
    <inputfile>   is the file where instances are defined
    <outputfile>  is where the data will be stored.

RUN EXAMPLE:

  ./Pancakes28.astar_gap ../instances/pancake28.txt results/pancake28.csvs
